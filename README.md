# Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

This project uses the NSL-KDD dataset to build an ML-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It includes preprocessing, model training with Decision Tree and ANN, and optional Streamlit deployment.

## Files Included
- `ids.ipynb`: Full notebook
- `app.py`: Streamlit UI
- `ids_model.keras`: Trained model
- `KDDTrain+.txt`: Sample dataset (or download link)

## Dataset
[Download NSL-KDD Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
